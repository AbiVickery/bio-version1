    <h1>My name is <b>Abigail Vickery</b>.</h1>
    <h2><p>I have <i>aspergers autism</i> and can be a bit of an introvert.</p>
        <p>I like to make digital art on my iPad or iPhone. I also like to make music on the Garage band app.</p><p>I’m a part of a couple different fandoms, including but not limited to </p>
    <li>Tales of Miraculous Ladybug and Cat Noir</li>
    <li>My Little Pony Friendship is Magic</li>
    <li>Pokemon</li>
    <li>Steven Universe</li>
    <li>How To Train Your Dragon</li>
        <p>I have had aspergers autism since I was 3-5 years old.<img src="C:\Users\abiga\Desktop\Lessons\media/Autism_Awareness_Ribbon.png" alt="Asperger's Syndrome." width="500" height="500" />
             What this means is that while I have a higher than average IQ, I struggle with social skills and cues sometimes.</p> 
    <p>When I turned 10 years old, my family moved to Mississippi for my dad’s job. He works in the I.T. department at the University Of Mississippi Hospital.
        I graduated school of class 2019. Not a lot of kids with autism actually graduate, so it was a little bit of a big deal, at least to my mom it was. 
        For college, I will go to a coding academy in downtown Jackson. There, I will learn the skills that will make me a lot of money in the future.</p></h2>
